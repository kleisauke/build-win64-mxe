## TODO
- [ ] Let Travis build libvips with pre-compiled dependencies.
  - [ ] Wait for: [mxe/mxe#2021](https://github.com/mxe/mxe/issues/2021).
- [ ] Incorporate all new dependencies and patches into [MXE](https://github.com/mxe/mxe).
  - [ ] Should we also add libvips-web?
  - [x] Not sure about `librsvg`, because v2.42.0+ requires the Rust toolchain.
- [ ] Try to test the binaries with the Python test suite on Wine.
- [ ] Incorporate the llvm-mingw toolchain plugin into MXE (see [mxe/mxe#2330](https://github.com/mxe/mxe/issues/2330)).
  - [x] Test the `armv7-w64-mingw32` target on a Raspberry Pi 3 with Windows 10 IoT.
    - [x] Compiling with `-O3 -ffast-math` throws a stack overflow exception (`0xC00000FD`) at runtime. Removing the `-ffast-math` flag seems to resolve this.
  - [ ] Test the `aarch64-w64-mingw32` target. Perhaps there's a VM to test this architecture?
  - [ ] The VIPS test suite should be able to run successfully on ARM/ARM64.
  - [x] Build LLVM for the target architecture (`-DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD=`) instead of constantly building all four architectures (i686, x86_64, armv7 and arm64).
  - [ ] [`libffi`](8.9/patches/libffi-3-fixes.patch), [`openslide`](8.9/patches/openslide-3-fixes.patch) ([mstorsjo/llvm-mingw#67](https://github.com/mstorsjo/llvm-mingw/issues/67)), [`hdf5`](8.9/patches/hdf5-1-fixes.patch) and [`glib`](8.9/patches/glib-2-fixes.patch) needs llvm-mingw specific patches. Fix them upstream or within LLVM.
  - [ ] The Rust MinGW-w64 ARM/ARM64 targets are not yet supported, is there an alternative way to build librsvg for these architectures?
