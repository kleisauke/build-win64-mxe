Subject: [PATCH 1/3] Revert "clip-boxes:  Drop too-early return"

This reverts commit cb871c6c692af68d8e0bf9e26472af45435f8a2c.

The original code is badly, but removing the early return leads to
crashes.  This code will need a lot more attention to get right, for now
at least go back to the original behavior.
